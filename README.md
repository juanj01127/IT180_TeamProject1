4. Predictive Modeling for Future Performance
Research Question: Can we predict a player's future performance (e.g., next season's batting average or ERA) based on their past performance and other factors?

Data Tables to Use: People, Batting, Pitching, Fielding, Teams
Analysis Approach: Develop predictive models using historical data as features (previous seasons' stats, age, team performance metrics). Techniques could include linear regression for continuous outcomes.
