# IT180_TeamProject1  Juan/Zack/Ray

Welcome to our project repository! Here, we will be hosting all of our project files.

Guideline on how the work process should be: 
-Add Code on your testing branch. 
-Merge to develop.
-If everything works ok, I will merge to Main branch. 


## Predictive Modeling for Future Performance

**Research Question:** Can we predict a player's future performance (e.g., next season's batting average or ERA) based on their past performance and other factors?

**Data Tables to Use:** 
- People
- Batting
- Pitching
- Fielding
- Teams

**Analysis Approach:** 
We aim to develop predictive models using historical data as features, including previous seasons' statistics, age, and team performance metrics. Techniques may include linear regression for continuous outcomes.

## DAY 1 PREP

**Agenda:**
- **Problem:** Define the problem statement and its significance.
- **Success Criteria:** Determine what defines success for our project.
- **Metrics:** Identify the metrics we'll use to measure success and how they'll be calculated.
- **Data:** Assess the data sources and requirements.
- **Tasks for Today:** Outline specific tasks to be completed.
- **Prepare for Next Meeting:** Set objectives and agenda items for the upcoming meeting.

## Today's Focus:
- **Problem Definition:** Clearly articulate the problem statement and its scope.
- **Data Exploration:** Begin exploring the available datasets and understand their structure.
- **Team Roles:** Assign roles and responsibilities for efficient progress.
- **Outline Project Plan:** Draft an initial project plan outlining key milestones and timelines.

## Prepare for Next Meeting:
- Review progress made today.
- Discuss any roadblocks encountered.
- Refine project objectives if necessary.
- Assign tasks for the next session.
